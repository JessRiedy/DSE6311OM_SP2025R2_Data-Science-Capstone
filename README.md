# Forecasting Mental Health Service Utilization: A Google Trends-Based Approach for State-Level Prediction
Can Google Trends data be used to accurately Predict the overall utilization rate
of mental health services at the state level for the upcoming year?
## What need does it fill?
1. Enhanced public health planning: Accurate predictions can inform policy
decisions, program development, and intervention strategies.
2. Improved mental health resource allocation by the state: By accurately
predicting mental health service utilization rates, a state can allocate
resources more effectively.

## Why is it worth your time/effort to explore this question?
1. Google Trends offers a creative approach: Google Trends provides real-
time data, thus timely and informed insights into mental health concerns.
2. Current methods limitations: traditional methods for predicting mental
health services utilization, mostly rely on historical data.
3. Mental health is a growing concern in modern times; therefore, an
accurate real-time prediction can help address this situation.

## What is your hypothesis?
There is a significant positive correlation between Google Trends data
related to mental health concerns and utilization rate of mental health services, this is
because increased online searches of mental health information reflect growing public
awareness and concern about mental health issues which in turn drives demand for
mental health services.

## What is your prediction?
Using Google Trend data, we predict that states with higher search
volumes for mental health-related terms (e.g., depression, therapy) will experience a
higher utilization rate of mental health services in the upcoming year as compared to
the previous year.
